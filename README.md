## jakemisc

The personal R package of Jake Sherman. Contained are misc functions and data that I have created/collected that I hope others may find useful. 

Note that as of December 2015 I am no longer maintaining this package. I have decided that any functions that are useful beyond myself will be split off into separate packages or micropackages (see my [packages](https://github.com/jakesherman/packages) package as an example). The conventional wisdom in the R community is that it is better to have many small packages that each do one thing well than to have one big package that tries to do many things. I will do my best to honor this. I am not going to take down this repo as some of the functions here still may be of some use. Looking back through this package it's fun to see how far my R skills have come since I started!

## Installation

This package is under development, and therefore is not yet on CRAN. It is easy to from GitHub using [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html).

```
devtools::install_github("jakesherman/jakemisc")
```
